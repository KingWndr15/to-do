# Vue.js and Express Todo Application

This is a simple Todo application built using Vue.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend, with data stored in Firebase Firestore.

## Features

- View a list of todos
- Add a new todo
- Delete a todo
- Toggle completion status of a todo

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js
- Vuex (for state management)
- Express.js
- Firebase Firestore (as the database)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Firebase project with Firestore database
- Vue CLI installed (`npm install -g @vue/cli`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vue-express-todo.git
   cd vue-express-todo
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd client
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure Firebase:

   - Create a Firebase project: [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Obtain your Firebase project configuration.
   - Save the configuration in `server/serviceAccountKey.json`.

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   # Start the frontend (from the 'client' directory)
   cd client
   npm run serve

   # Start the backend (from the 'server' directory)
   cd ../server
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be available at http://localhost:8080, and the backend will be running at http://localhost:3000.
